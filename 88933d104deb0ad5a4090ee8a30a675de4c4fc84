      "message": "This question probably goes back to the current KeyValyeDao DAO interface but:\n\nAny particular reason these methods wouldn\u0027t be part of the parent interface (BaseObjectStore, and BaseDAO?) since there is nothing specific in these methods that are valid only for a Key-Value object store? I understand separating functionality to keep interfaces simple but I am not sure about the naming \"KeyValue\".",

      "message": "This interface deals with the entire set of objects (get, size, clear); they weren\u0027t included in the parent interface because some implementations may require extra work to support dealing with the entire set. Cassandra is an example, in order to count all objects ore retrieve all objects you have to create a dedicated column family. So we wanted to give the option to create a simple Dao/Store that only supports CRUD operations (BaseDao, BaseObjectStore). \nWe gave the name KeyValue because it behaves similar to a map which supports CRUD operations but also retrieving all objects, clearing and counting all.\nSome implementations (Like SQL-based) already support this operations for free; so for example there won\u0027t be a JpaBaseDao implementation, we will provide a JpaKeyValueDao implementation directly, which can be used as Base or KeyValue.\nNow that you mention naming, I wonder whether we should rename BaseDao to CrudDao. What do you think?\nAbout the name KeyValueDao we didn\u0027t like the name either. Another option was MapDao. What do you think?",
