/**
 * Thrown by the persistence provider to reflect an integrity constraint violation:
 * <p>
 * Documentation taken from: http://beginner-sql-tutorial.com/sql-integrity-constraints.htm
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Primary Key Integrity Constraint:</strong> This constraint defines a column or
 * combination of columns which uniquely identifies each row in the table. The key must not be null
 * and it must be unique</li>
 * <li><strong>Unique Integrity Constraint:</strong> This constraint ensures that a column or a
 * group of columns in each row have a distinct value. A column(s) can have a null value but the
 * values cannot be duplicated.</li>
 * <li><strong>Foreign Key or Referential Integrity:</strong> This constraint identifies any column
 * referencing the PRIMARY KEY in another table. It establishes a relationship between two columns
 * in the same table or between different tables. For a column to be defined as a Foreign Key, it
 * should be a defined as a Primary Key in the table which it is referring. One or more columns can
 * be defined as Foreign key.</li>
 * <li><strong>Not Null Constraint:</strong> This constraint ensures all rows in the table contain a
 * definite value for the column which is specified as not null. Which means a null value is not
 * allowed.</li>
 * </ul>
